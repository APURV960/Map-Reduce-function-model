# Map-Reduce-function-model
MapReduce helped to calculate the average daily temperature for each locality from thousands of IoT sensor readings by distributing the data to multiple machines it minimizes the workload and computing with several mapper and reducer in parallel. It is the most efficient approach to handle such a large dataset which is continuously increasing as the sensor all across the city inputs and store the data for processing. In the Map step, data is broken down and organized into key, value pairs, while in the Reduce step these values are combined to produce a final result. This makes it possible to process huge dataset quickly and efficiently across many machines at the same time. 

Q>A smart city platform collects temperature and humidity readings every minute from 2000 IoT sensors. Describe how you would apply the MapReduce programming model to compute the average daily temperature for each locality in the city.

=>
The dataset acquired from 2000 iot sensors where minute in a day
